        <h1>Node.js</h1>
        <p>Node.js is a powerful, open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server. Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for building scalable and high-performance network applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and well-suited for real-time applications, such as chat applications, online gaming, and live streaming. Node.js includes a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules through its package manager, npm (Node Package Manager), which facilitates rapid development. With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript across the entire stack, enabling seamless communication between the client and server sides.</p>
