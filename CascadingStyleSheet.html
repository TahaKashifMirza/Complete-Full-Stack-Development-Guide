        <h1>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</h1>
        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be rendered on screen, paper, or in other media. It allows developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look and feel of a website, separating content from design. CSS rules are made up of selectors and declarations, where the selector targets HTML elements, and the declaration specifies the styles to apply. CSS also supports responsive design, enabling web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Mastering CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>
