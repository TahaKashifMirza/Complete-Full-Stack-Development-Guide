        <h1>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)</h1>
        <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the basic structure of a webpage, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. HTML consists of a series of elements, which are represented by tags. These tags label pieces of content such as "heading," "paragraph," "table," and so on. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With attributes, elements can also include additional information. Understanding HTML is fundamental to web development, as it forms the backbone of all web pages..</p>
