        <h1>MySQL (Database)</h1>
        <p>MySQL is a widely-used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability, performance, and ease of use. Developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation, MySQL uses structured query language (SQL) to manage and manipulate data within relational tables. It is highly favored for its robust feature set, which includes data integrity, ACID compliance for transaction management, and support for a wide range of storage engines. MySQL's scalability allows it to handle both small and large applications, from individual projects to large-scale enterprise systems. It is also renowned for its strong security features, high availability, and cross-platform compatibility, making it a versatile choice for web applications, data warehousing, and e-commerce platforms.</p>
