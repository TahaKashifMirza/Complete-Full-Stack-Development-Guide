        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language primarily used to create dynamic and interactive elements on web pages. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows developers to implement complex features such as form validations, animations, and asynchronous data fetching with APIs. It runs on the client side in the user's browser, but with the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used on the server side. JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. Mastering JavaScript is essential for modern web development, as it enables the creation of rich, user-friendly web experiences.</p>
