        <h1>Express.js (Framework)</h1>
        <p>Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications by offering a straightforward and powerful set of tools for handling HTTP requests, middleware integration, and routing. Express.js supports various middleware functions that can be used to handle different parts of the request-response cycle, making it easy to manage tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling. Its unopinionated nature allows developers to structure their applications in a way that best suits their needs, while its large ecosystem of plugins and extensions enhances its functionality. Express.js is widely used for building RESTful APIs and single-page applications due to its simplicity and flexibility.</p>
